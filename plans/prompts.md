go ahead and work on the game by using beads to guide your progress. if you encounter any new work items, put them in beads. rely on beads/bd to guide you and future agents. build a release build when you are done, not a debug build.


ok. thoroughly read through your bd epics and issues and ask me important clarifying questions. put the answers back into bd. bd is the only place to store information that guide the project
