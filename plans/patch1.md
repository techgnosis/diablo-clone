game works great. lets make a few changes.

first, when the player picks up an item, show a little temporary indicator over the characters head. maybe just words that say
"item collected!"

second, lets have the character face the direction its walking. the character is currently always facing to the right of the
screen

as always, plan out the required steps using bead/bd. then, thoroughly review bd and ask me any questions you have about the
changes and store the results in bd.
