this project uses Rust and Macroquad to create a Diablo clone.

this game is like diablo but much simpler obviously.

make a detailed plan for creating this game and store the plan as epics and issues in bd. Do NOT write any plans as separate files.

# world
world is autogenerated. its mostly just a very plain terrain with random stuff on the ground like rocks and cactuses and such. the world is all one contiguous plane. each different terrain slowly blends into the next one instead of seeing a hard changeover.

the terrains can be grass, desert, snow

grass can have rocks, trees

desert can have cactuses, bones

snow can have snowy rocks and snowy trees

# character

there is no character design. you start the game as a generic looking fellow.

# weapons
you start with a two-handed sword. there are no shields, only two handed weapons.

weapons can be: swords, axes, maces

swords do 1-10 damage

axes do 5-8 damage

maces do 7 damage

# armor
there is only one armor slot. when you change your armor your whole appearance changes.

armor can be: leather, chainmail, platemail

leather reduces damage by 10

chainmail reduces by 20

platemail reduces damage by 30

# inventory
you can push 'i' to open your inventory. the only items you can ever pick up and have in your inventory are weapons and armor. 

# drops
monsters sometimes drop weapons and armor when they die

# monsters
lets do two monsters per terrain type. 

grass has goblins and ogres

desert has orcs and wyrms

snow has snow goblins and snow ogres

goblins have 10 life
ogres have 30 life
orcs have 20 life
wyrms have 50 life

goblins do 5 damage
ogres do 8 damage
orcs do 6 damage
wyrms do 10 damage

# health
you have 50 health and it regenerates at 1/s no matter what unless its full

# combat
when you swing you always hit

# UI
show a health meter with numbers on it, from 0/50
