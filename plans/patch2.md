lets make some changes to the game. please read all of these changes and make bd issues and epics as you see fit.


BUG: the weapon should always be facing up, no matter what direction the character is moving. Currently if the character moves downward then the weapon points out from the bottom left or bottom right corner. The weapon should always be out of the top left or top right corner.

FEATURE: Allow standard WASD controls as well as arrows. W is UP, A is LEFT, S is DOWN, D is RIGHT.

FEATURE: Make the monsters look like more than circles. The player character resembles a little human. Can you make the monsters all look somewhat distinct.

* goblins have big green ears
* ogres have a big club
* orcs have fangs
* wyrms have wings
* snow goblins can be goblins but white

Lets change the snow 
* snow ogres becomes a yeti. make it look hairy and white and bigger than a goblin

FIX: the armor is too strong currently. lets change to:
* leather reduces damage by 1 instead of 10
* chainmail reduces by 2 instead of 20
* platemail reduces damage by 4 instead of 30
